"""
Indexing is distributed across multiple independent hosts. We don't want to
"go live" in production with the newly indexed data until all of the indexing
workers have finished their tasks. To that end, we need to track the state of
each worker, and be notified when the job has finished.

State is persisted to the disk using shelve. Concurrent writes aren't allowed,
so all operations need to acquire a lock.
