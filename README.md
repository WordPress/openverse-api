# Openverse API

## Purpose

The Openverse API (`openverse-api`) is a system that allows programmatic access to public domain digital media. It is our ambition to index and catalog [billions of openly-licensed works](https://stateof.creativecommons.org/), including articles, songs, videos, photographs, paintings, and more. Using this API, developers will be able to access the digital commons in their own applications.

This repository is primarily concerned with back end infrastructure like datastores, servers, and APIs. The pipeline that feeds data into this system can be found in the [Openverse Catalog repository](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse-catalog). A front end web application that interfaces with the API can be found at the [Openverse frontend repository](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse-frontend).

## API Documentation

In the [API documentation](https://api.openverse.engineering), you can find more details about the endpoints with examples on how to use them.

## How to Run the Server Locally

### Prerequisites

You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [PostgreSQL client tools](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). On Debian, the package is called `postgresql-client-common`. You'll also want to install the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner.

### Running locally

1. Run the [Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/)
2. Open your command prompt (CMD) or terminal
3. Clone Openverse API

```
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/openverse-api.git
```

4. Change directories with `cd openverse-api`
5. Start Openverse API locally by running the docker containers. You can use usual `docker-compose` commands or the simplified `just` command. You will need the [just](https://github.com/casey/just#installation) command runner installed to follow the next steps.

```
just up
```

6. Wait until your CMD or terminal displays that it is starting development server at `http://0.0.0.0:8000/`

7. Open up your browser and type `localhost:8000` in the search tab
8. Make sure you see the local API documentation
   ![Local API Documentation](local_api_documentation.PNG)
9. Open a new CMD or terminal and change directory to `openverse-api`
10. Still in the new CMD or terminal, load the sample data. This script requires a local postgres installation to connect to and alter our database.

```
just init
```

11. Still in the new CMD or terminal, hit the API with a request

```
just healthcheck
```

12. Make sure you see the following response from the API
    ![Sample API_Request](localhost_request.PNG)

Congratulations! You just ran the server locally.

To access the logs run:

```
just logs
```

That will follow all the logs for all the services. To isolate a service, simply pass the service name, for example:

```
just logs web
```

### What Happens In the Background

After executing `just up` (in Step 5), you will be running:

- A Django API server
- Two PostgreSQL instances (one simulates the upstream data source, the other serves as the application database)
- Elasticsearch
- Redis
- A thumbnail-generating image proxy
- ingestion-server, a service for bulk ingesting and indexing search data.
- analytics, a REST API server for collecting search usage data

### Diagnosing local Elasticsearch issues

If the API server container failed to start, there's a good chance that Elasticsearch failed to start on your machine. Ensure that you have allocated enough memory to Docker applications, otherwise the container will instantly exit with an error. Also, if the logs mention "insufficient max map count", increase the number of open files allowed on your system. For most Linux machines, you can fix this by adding the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```
vm.max_map_count=262144
```

To make this setting take effect, run:

```
sudo sysctl -p
```

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](system_architecture.png)

### Basic flow of data

Search data is ingested from upstream sources provided by the [data pipeline](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse-catalog). As of the time of writing, this includes data from Common Crawl and multiple 3rd party APIs. Once the data has been scraped and cleaned, it is transferred to the upstream database, indicating that it is ready for production use.

Every week, the latest version of the data is automatically bulk copied ("ingested") from the upstream database to the production database by the Ingestion Server. Once the data has been downloaded and indexed inside of the database, the data is indexed in Elasticsearch, at which point the new data can be served up from the Openverse API servers.

### Description of subprojects

- _openverse-api_ is a Django Rest Framework API server. For a full description of its capabilities, please see the [browsable documentation](https://api.openverse.engineering).
- _ingestion-server_ is a service for downloading and indexing search data once it has been prepared by the Openverse Catalog
- _analytics_ is a Falcon REST API for collecting usage data.

## Running the tests

### How to Run API live integration tests

You can check the health of a live deployment of the API by running the live integration tests.

1. Run the install recipe:

```
just install
```

#### On the host

1. Run the tests in a Pipenv subshell.
```
just testlocal
```

#### Inside the container

1. Run the tests in an interactive TTY connected to a `web` container.
```
just test
```

### How to Run Ingestion Server tests

You can ingest and index some dummy data using the Ingestion Server API.

1. Change directory to ingestion server

```
cd ingestion_server
```

2. Install all dependencies for Ingestion Server API

```
pipenv install
```

3. Launch a new shell session

```
pipenv shell
```

4. Run the integration tests

```
python3 test/integration_tests.py
```
