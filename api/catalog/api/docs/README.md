This documentation is focused towards consumers who are using the Openverse API.
The developer documentation for the Openverse API can be found [here]().


# Introduction

The Openverse API is a system that allows programmatic access
to public domain digital media. It is our ambition to index and catalog billions
of openly-licensed works, including articles, songs, videos, photographs,
paintings, and more. Using this API, developers will be able to access the
digital commons in their own applications.

Please note that there is a rate limit of 5000 requests per day and 60 requests
per minute rate limit in place for anonymous users. This is fine for introducing
yourself to the API, but we strongly recommend that you obtain an API key as
soon as possible. Authorized clients have a higher rate limit of 10000 requests
per day and 100 requests per minute. Additionally, Openverse can give your key
an even higher limit that fits your application's needs. See the
[Register and Authenticate section](#section/Register-and-Authenticate) for
instructions on obtaining an API key.

# Register and Authenticate

## Register for a key
Before using the Openverse API, you need to register access via OAuth2. This can
be done using the `/v1/auth_tokens/register` endpoint.

Example on how to register for a key:
```bash
$ curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My amazing project", "description": "To access Openverse API", "email": "user@example.com"}' \
  "https://api.openverse.engineering/v1/auth_tokens/register"
```
If your request is successful, you will get a `client_id` and `client_secret`.

Example of successful request:
```json
{
    "client_secret" : "YhVjvIBc7TuRJSvO2wIi344ez5SEreXLksV7GjalLiKDpxfbiM8qfUb5sNvcwFOhBUVzGNdzmmHvfyt6yU3aGrN6TAbMW8EOkRMOwhyXkN1iDetmzMMcxLVELf00BR2e",
    "client_id" : "pm8GMaIXIhkjQ4iDfXLOvVUUcIKGYRnMlZYApbda",
    "name" : "My amazing project"
}
```

## Authenticate
In order to use the Openverse API endpoints, you need to include access token in
the header. This can be done by exchanging your client credentials for a token
using the `/v1/auth_tokens/token/` endpoint.

Example on how to authenticate using OAuth2:
```bash
$ curl \
  -X POST \
  -d "client_id=pm8GMaIXIhkjQ4iDfXLOvVUUcIKGYRnMlZYApbda&client_secret=YhVjvIBc7TuRJSvO2wIi344ez5SEreXLksV7GjalLiKDpxfbiM8qfUb5sNvcwFOhBUVzGNdzmmHvfyt6yU3aGrN6TAbMW8EOkRMOwhyXkN1iDetmzMMcxLVELf00BR2e&grant_type=client_credentials" \
  "https://api.openverse.engineering/v1/auth_tokens/token/"
```
If your request is successful, you will get an access token.

Example of successful request:
```json
 {
    "access_token" : "DLBYIcfnKfolaXKcmMC8RIDCavc2hW",
    "scope" : "read write groups",
    "expires_in" : 36000,
    "token_type" : "Bearer"
 }
```

Check your email for a verification link. After you have followed the link, your
API key will be activated.

## Using Access Token
Include the `access_token` in the authorization header to use your key in your
future API requests.

Example on how to make an authenticated request:
```bash
$ curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer DLBYIcfnKfolaXKcmMC8RIDCavc2hW" \
  "https://api.openverse.engineering/v1/images?q=test"
```

> **NOTE:** Your token will be throttled like an anonymous user until the email
> address has been verified.
