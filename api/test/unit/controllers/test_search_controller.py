    Testing "branch 1" in the function code.

    This test case is aimed at when a search does not yet have a query mask
    because the search has never before been executed.

    ``start`` is pinned to 0 because when a query mask does not exist, the query
    must start at 0 due to the fact that the validity of the query results is not
    known. We can't reliably skip any number of results due to potentially dead
    links. If we didn't start maskless queries at 0, then query pagination would
    not line up in a deterministic way.

    Take for example, the following list of result liveness:
    [True, False, False, False, False, True, True]
     0     1      2      3      4      5     6

    If we do not have a query mask to represent this, but we request page 2 of size 2,
    where should we start the query? We would want to start at index 2 (skipping the
    first page of 2 results), but in actuality we need to start at index 6 because
    the first page of 2 confirmed live results actually encompases the range from
    1 to 5, as that is the smallest window in which we can fulfill the requested
    _first_ page of results that we're skipping.

    Given this, if we don't know the link liveness (via a query mask) then we must
    start at 0.

    ``expected_end`` is always double the page size due to the current
    setting of ``DEAD_LINK_RATIO``. For pages beyond the first page,
    we are forced to compensate for two facts that cause the query size
    to grow at a dramatic rate:
    1. ``start`` being pinned to 0 (see explanation below)
    2. The presumed possibility that the first n results (where n = page_size * page),
    which represent the results we would _skip_ to reach the start of the page we
    actually want will be precisely live/dead at the ratio described by
    ``DEAD_LINK_RATIO``. Therefore, we're sort of "betting" on the fact that if we
    skip enough results to satisfy the dead link ratio's assumption and then grab enough
    results on the tail end to assume that the first pages are precisely dead/live at
    that ratio, then the page we actually want will definitely be inside of that range.
    Despite the large query size growth, it does seem that this is more or less reasonable
    though if the API receives a bunch of last page + max page size queries for original
    query terms it would cause a ton of very large query sizes to be sent to ES.

    of the bits and only using the bits to find the end of the query if the mask covers
